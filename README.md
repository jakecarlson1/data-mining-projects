# Data Mining Projects
Projects for CSE 5331 - Data Mining

## Project 1
Analyzing federal payroll data to see how the federal government was reshaped by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Looking at how well the presidents did at upholding their campaign promises and what major events caused them to alter the way they managed the government.

## Project 2
Using decision trees, random forests, and artifical neural networks to predict the pay and education level of federal employees based on the payroll data used in Project 1. A model is built to assist people in planning their careers if they are insterested in working for the federal government. The model allows potential employees to enter attributes about themselves as well as the type of role they are interested in and where they would like to work, and returns an annual pay approximation.

## Project 3
Using association rule mining to find frequent, closed, and maximal itemsets for federal employees. Data for the years 2005 and 2013 are compared to examine how common employee features change as Obama took power. I then look at features that are shared between supervisors and non-supervisors to see what agencies certain employees have a better chance of becoming leaders of.

## Project 4
Clustering.
